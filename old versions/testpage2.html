              No foe is safe from the Khinerai â€“ winged bringers of Morathi's vengeance. Devastate enemy armour with the javelin-throwing Heartrenders and cut a bloody path through infantry with the sickle-wielding Lifetakers.  <br />

            Mutated by the tortures of Slaanesh, the Melusai are the sinister elite of the Daughters of Khaine. All are precise and deadly warriors, whether they be the glaive-wielding Blood Sisters or the stealthy Blood Stalkers.
