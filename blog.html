      <p>The seventh legion is a Death Guard legion. A legion driven by sickness, decay and most of all death. The seventh legion started with a mere Lord of Contagion, Malignent Plague Caster, Plague Marines, Pox Walkers and a Foetid Bloat Drone. <br />

      However this legion, just as any other plague, keeps growing and growing. The logs describing the expansion and the warfare of below legion can be found below. But be wary reader, try not to succumb to the forces of Chaos or accept a certain death.</p>
